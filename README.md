# Protect Your Things

## Description

What I have created is a password generator that will specifically allow the user to create a password between the lengths of 8-128 characters that has the ability to include or exclude alphabet, numbers and special characters. The reason for creating this simple app is to practice and apply javascript concepts that take user information and returns a result that matches the criteria they set. With this simple generator, you are able to produce random passwords to use for most use cases so that you can have more security on your private information. Completing this project allowed me to practice coding in javascript including basic concepts such as variables, functions, and if statements.

## Credits

I googled many concepts referring to functions and variables. I also referred to many class activites for ideas on how to use if and else statements.
